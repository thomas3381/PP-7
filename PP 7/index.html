            <h2>1. Why Does PayPal Limit Accounts?</h2>
            <p>PayPal places limitations on accounts for various reasons, usually related to security or regulatory compliance. Some common reasons include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Suspicious activity:</strong> Unusual transactions or login attempts may trigger account restrictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Failure to provide required documents:</strong> PayPal may ask for identification or proof of address to verify your identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-compliance with PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> Engaging in activities that violate PayPal's terms could lead to limitations.</li>
                <li><strong>Chargebacks or disputes:</strong> Multiple chargebacks or unresolved disputes can result in an account being limited.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If any of these situations occur, PayPal may limit your account, which means you may not be able to access your funds or make transactions until the issue is resolved.</p>
